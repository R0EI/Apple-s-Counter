Apple's-Counter
Counting how many apples are in my DB?
===

> Containerized serivces

This project launches a website that displays how many apples are in my DB?
That's a great question, although the real task in here is the use of containers.

> To execute the server:
- Pull the repo
- Write in the console "./installings.sh"
- Write again in the console "./run.sh"


Immediately, after downloading and installing all the dependencies, the web will show with accuracy, how many apples are in the DB,
even different kind of apples.


In order to really Indicate that it works, u can change the "init-db.js" file, which holds the dump for our DB, and notice the number of apples
in the web is changed accordingly.
